This is a base64 library for Lua 5.0. Base64 is a format for coding binary
data with text used in MIME.

To try this Lua library, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua.
Then run make. This will build lbase64.so and run a simple test. If everything
is ok, install lbase64.so and base64.lua in some official place. You may want
to edit base64.lua to change the default value of SOPATH (you can also set the
environment variable LUA_SOPATH at run time).

Here is a brief explanation of the files in this package:
  lbase64.c        base64 library
  base64.lua       support code
  test.lua         test code

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive. There are two
functions: encode and decode. The examples in test.lua show the library in
action.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to lhf@tecgraf.puc-rio.br .
